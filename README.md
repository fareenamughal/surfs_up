# SurfsUp

## Overview of the statistical analysis
___

The analysis aimed to examine the temperature for Oahu for the month of June and December, so as to determine whether the surf and ice cream shop business would be sustainable all year-round. The main aim was to determine the viability of setting up a surf and ice cream business in Oahu.

___

### Results
___

The temprature of Oahu is compared for 2 months, June and December. The main statistical data can be discussed by comparing the following and also summarized in the diagram below: 

1. Minimum temperature - December has a lower min.temp of 56 degrees ferenheight compared to June's min temps of 64 degrees ferenheight 
2. Maximum temperature -  - December has a slightly lower max.temp of 83 degrees ferenheight compared to June's max temps of 85 degrees ferenheight 
3. Mean - June's average temperature is higher at 74.94 degrees ferenheight compared to December's average of 71.04 degrees ferenheight
4. Standard deviation - June's standard deviation is 3.25 compared to Decembers 3.74. This implies the difference between the average and highest and lowest temperatures (range) is more for the month of December compared to that of June.
5. Interquartile range (difference between 3rd quartile and 1st quartile) - for the month of June is 6 degrees ferenheight as compared to December at 7.5 degrees ferenheight. This also implies there are relative more high and low temperatures from the average in December that June.


### Summary of the statistics for the month of June and December

### Summary
___

In general, the temperature data for both June and December indicates that the data may be skewed as both the minimum and maximum temperatures lie outside the values as calculated using the Standard deviation and Interquartile Range. Further investigation would need to be done to determine whether the data collected was accurate. It is also possible that in reality, on some days the temperatures may actually vary much more from the average temperature. One would need to determine the number of such occurances as this can have an impact on daily sales with no sales on colder days and higher sales on hotter days. One would also need to look at the full years data before making an investment decision. If temperature and rainfall variances still enable sales projections to breakeven and surpass the breakeven point it would be worth investing and exploring other services that could be offered on days when temperatureas are low and or receive more rainfall.  

### Additional queries to be run

1. Another query to be run would be to determine which month has more rainfall or receives more precipitation. As is seen from the additional summary statiticts run in the SurfsUp Challenge file, the month of December receives more rainfall than June 0.216mm compared to 0.136mm respectively. The highest percipitation value for December is also 6.4mm compared to 4.43mm for June. This signifies that December sales may be impacted by the number of rainy days and June may be a better month. It would also be a good idea to recheck the data as the percipitation counts for bot Dec and June are different, lower from the temperature counts for June and December. Perhaps some missing data or null values in the data.
2. Also it would be a good idea to consider checing the overall rainfall pattern to identify whether sales would be of a cyclic nature and also to determine the overall impact on sales for the entire year. 
3. Another query to be run would be to check the information for other stations and see their viability in terms of fairly standard temperatureas and rainfall patterns so as to calculate the annual revenue potential before setting up shop in an area.
4. Altitude information can also be checked as higher altitudes will be relatively colder than the lower altitudes.
